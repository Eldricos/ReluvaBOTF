# Star Trek: Birth of the Federation: `.fnt` fonts

Status: **readable**: every glyph's place and advance, and how to draw it.
Open: three header fields, and how the game colours text. Reader:
`src/engines/botf/font.cpp`; the viewer's Fonts page shows them.

Source: the first 2 KB of all 21 fonts in the English `stbof.res`, and two
whole fonts, `generic9.fnt` and `human15.fnt` (`scripts/botf_fonts.py`),
October 2026. Glyph cells were found by their frame lines in both whole
fonts and compared with the header; the characters were read from the
glyphs drawn large.

21 fonts: `human`, `klingn`, `romuln`, `ferngi` and `cardsn` (one per race,
see [res.md](res.md)) at 9, 15, 20 and 28 point, and `generic9.fnt`.

All values little-endian.

```
offset 0    u8  line height      the sheet's row pitch: glyph height + 1 (10, 16, 21, 29)
offset 1    u8  ?                0 in the 9-point fonts, 1 in the others
offset 2    u8  space advance?   4 (9 and 15 point) or 5 (20 and 28); no glyph is a space
offset 3    u8  ?                1 (9 and 15 point), 2 (20), 3 (28)
offset 4    u16 10               in every font
offset 6    u16 120              the number of glyphs
offset 8    u16 sheet width
offset 10   u16 sheet height
offset 12   u32 sheet size       the TGA's size after its 18-byte header
offset 16   u8  ?                0 in the 9-point fonts, 1 in the others
offset 17   u8  ?                6; 7 in generic9.fnt
offset 18   u16 86               in every font
offset 20   u16 advance[120]     per glyph, in sheet order: its width in pixels + 1
offset 260  a 16-bit TGA         the glyph sheet
```

The sheet is an uncompressed 16-bit TGA (type 2, rows from the bottom up),
some with a 26-byte TGA 2.0 footer (the sheet size counts it). Its height
is 5 x the line height + 1 (the 9-point sheets have a row or two more).

## The glyph sheet

Five rows of cells, each cell framed by 1-pixel lines of one colour (white
in `generic9.fnt`, green `0x03F1` in the race fonts) that also run along
the top of the sheet and between the rows. Row r's cells start at
y = r x line height + 1 and are line height - 1 tall. Inside a cell the
background is black; the glyph is drawn in its own colours: two colours in
the 9-point fonts, grey levels (anti-aliasing) in the larger ones.

Each cell is as wide as its advance - 1, except the first cell of rows 2 to
5, which is a pixel wider (in both whole fonts). Reluva therefore finds the
cells by their frame lines (a column of frame colour all the way down a
row ends a cell) and takes the advances from the header. In both whole
fonts this finds 120 cells, in rows of 10, 26, 26, 32 and 26, and all the
other widths agree with the header.

The glyphs, in order (the header's advances are in the same order):

| Row | Glyphs |
|---|---|
| 1 | `1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0` |
| 2 | `A` to `Z` |
| 3 | `a` to `z` |
| 4 | `` ` - = \ [ ] ; ' , . / ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * ( ) _ + \| { } : " < > ? `` (a US keyboard's keys, unshifted then shifted) |
| 5 | `ä â à ê è é ï î ö ô ü ñ Ç ç Ä Ö Ü ß ® © ™ … — ¿ ¡` and a short dash, taken as `–` |

`generic9.fnt` leaves row 4 empty but for the apostrophe: its other cells
are framed and blank.

## Open

- How the game colours text. The race fonts' glyphs are grey, so the game
  probably tints them; Reluva's viewer draws them as stored.
- Bytes 1, 3, 16 and 17 and the values 10 and 86. Byte 2 is taken as the
  space's advance (there is no space glyph); the running game will show
  whether that's right.
- Which code page the game's text uses for row 5's characters (Windows-1252
  has all of them).
